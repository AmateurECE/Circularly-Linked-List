<b>A Circularly Linked List!</b>
This is my attempt at implementing, well, you know. I finished up the first try, and compiled it, and I got a segmentation fault almost immediately.
I checked the code with an old data structures book I have, and I wasn't that far off. I fixed whatever errors I found, and still the same problem. After a grueling hour or two of debugging with LLDB, I discovered that for whatever reason, when clist_insnxt was called, the second parameter (reference node; list->head in the test file) was not copied over to the stack. But only the second? The other two parameters were. It was pretty weird. I messed around with it a little while longer, and at some point it just kind of...worked. So, I dunno? But whatever the problem was, it isn't happening any longer.
